Read me:

Front end: angularjs
back end: node.js

This is simple rest project which shows how to get data from back end 


To run back end
  go to songsApp/back_end and then run following command
  npm start run
  
  Note:  server address is  localhost:5000/api/songs/
  
  To start front end:
   go to songsApp/front_end
     open index.html file using web browser
